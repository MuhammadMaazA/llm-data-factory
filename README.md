# 🤖 llm-data-factory: A Synthetic Data Weaver

This project demonstrates how to use a large, powerful "Teacher" language model (like GPT-4) to generate a high-quality synthetic dataset, which is then used to fine-tune a much smaller, more efficient "Student" language model (like Microsoft's Phi-3-mini).

The goal is to create a specialized, cost-effective classifier for a real-world task—in this case, classifying customer support tickets—without needing a large, hand-labeled dataset. This approach showcases modern MLOps techniques like synthetic data generation and model distillation.

## 🚀 Core Idea & Motivation

In many real-world machine learning projects, a major bottleneck is the lack of large, high-quality labeled datasets. This project tackles that problem head-on.

1.  **Problem:** We need an accurate model to classify customer support tickets, but we only have a small number of labeled examples.
2.  **Hypothesis:** We can use a powerful, general-purpose LLM (a "Teacher") to understand the task from just a few examples and generate thousands of new, realistic examples.
3.  **Solution:** We then use this rich, synthetic dataset to fine-tune a small, open-weight LLM (a "Student").
4.  **Result:** The final "Student" model is highly specialized, fast, cheap to run, and can be deployed anywhere, all while achieving performance comparable to models many times its size.

This project covers the full AI lifecycle: **Data Scarcity → Data Generation → Efficient Fine-Tuning → Evaluation → Deployment.**

## ⚙️ How to Run This Project

### Quick Start

For the fastest setup experience, we provide interactive setup scripts:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuhammadMaazA/llm-data-factory.git
cd llm-data-factory

# Interactive setup with menu
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# OR start everything at once
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

See [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.

### Manual Setup

Follow these steps to manually set up the project:

#### 1. Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuhammadMaazA/llm-data-factory.git
cd llm-data-factory
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Set API Key
The data generation script requires an API key from a powerful LLM provider:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'
```

#### 3. Generate the Synthetic Data
Run the generation script to create training data:

```bash

python scripts/01_generate_synthetic_data.py
```

This might take some time and incur API costs, depending on the number of samples you generate.

#### 4. Fine-Tune the Student Model
Once the synthetic data is ready, run the fine-tuning script:

```bash
python scripts/02_finetune_student_model.py
```

The final model artifacts will be saved to the `./final_student_model` directory.

#### 5. Evaluate and Launch
Open the `notebooks/evaluation.ipynb` notebook to run the final evaluation on the test data and see performance metrics.

Launch the interactive demo:

```bash
# Start the FastAPI backend
cd app && python api_server.py

# In another terminal, start the React frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### Complete Pipeline

For automated end-to-end training, use our pipeline script:

```bash
python run_complete_pipeline.py
📊 Results & Evaluation

Export to Sheets
As shown, our fine-tuned student model achieves performance remarkably close to the powerful Teacher model but at a fraction of the computational cost, proving the effectiveness of this approach.

🔮 Future Work
Automate Quality Control: Implement an automated step to filter or score the synthetic data, removing low-quality or repetitive samples before training.
Experiment with Student Models: Swap out Phi-3-mini for other small models like Gemma 2B or Qwen 1.5B to compare performance.
Expand Label Taxonomy: Increase the number of classification labels to handle more nuanced support ticket types.
